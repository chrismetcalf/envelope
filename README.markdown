## Background

Adapted from https://github.com/evmar/envelope to solve the age-old question of how to print Christmas card
envelopes.

## The Code

The code is shorter than this README, but briefly:

1. Create a CSV with the data you want, like one address per row with
   one line per column. (We used Google Docs, which can export CSV.)
2. Modify the constants in the `__main__` block of the code.
3. Run it, print the PDF using whatever PDF program you like. Make sure you're using a paper size that
   matches your envelopes.
